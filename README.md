The Linux system call stat provides information of a specific file on the hard drive. More information about this system call can be found on the Internet or by typing man 2 stat on the Linux shell.



Your task is to use stat to write a program that asks the user for the name of the file, which is located in  the same directory as the executable, and displays the size of that file in bytes.
